# ComfyUI Workflows
## ComfyUI workflows for SD and SDXL Image Generation (ENG y ESP)
## English

If you have any red nodes and some errors when you load it, just go to the ComfyUI Manager and select "Import Missing Nodes" and install them. You need to download the chekpoints, controlnet models, etc. by yourself. I will soon leave in the description all the needed things to get it up to work

1. SDXL Txt2Image + Image2Image + Inpaint + InstantID + IPAdapter + ReActor
   This workflow is a general workflow that allows you to enable and disable nodes easily, so changing from txt2image to image2image is as simple as enabling it in the Red Fast Group Muter

   Example:

   Then I disabled everything, and enabled Inpaint. Masked the watermark, and this is the end result:
